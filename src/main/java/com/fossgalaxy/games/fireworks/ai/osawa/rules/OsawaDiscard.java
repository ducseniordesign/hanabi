/**
 * Osawa has strange notions of discard and play - this tries to enumerate them.
 *
 * If a card has enough information but is not playable after the turn, this card is defined as a discard-able card.
 * For example, if there is a red fireworks set with the number 4 on top, R1, R2, R3 are discard-able cards. If there
 * is a yellow fireworks set with the number 5 on top, any yellow card is discard-able without needing information
 * about the number.
